# An Adventure in learning React, Flux, and Express

## ... or, REFLUXPRESS

This is a learning project - I wanted to try out building a React Router app on top of an Express-Mongo-powered back end, using Flux architecture.

This is a simple TODO app, which stores todo items in a database to be retrieved when the page is loaded.

Users can make new TODOs, edit TODOs, mark as completed, and delete. *in progress*

Eventually I will also add functionality to filter based on tags and categories.

Once I get that worked out, I want to learn authentication with React.

I love comments and feedback! Feel free to chime in. Thanks for reading.
